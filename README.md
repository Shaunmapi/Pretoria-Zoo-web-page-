# Pretoria-Zoo-web-page-
This project is my attempt at creating a complete webpage using everything I’ve learned in web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage is fully functional, with structured content, styling, and interactive elements. Future improvements will include adding additional JavaScript libraries and enhancing interactivity and user experience
